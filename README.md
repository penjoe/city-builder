## Overview
The purpose of this application is to give the user an easy means of finding activities to do for a given city location. By entering a cty, the user will get a list of food options, movies and weather for that given area, making it easier to help plan trips.

This app was created as a Code Fellows 301 class project with the purpose of learning how to create and deploy back-end servers. 

## Getting Started
To build this app yourself, here are the steps you need to take:
1. Make a github repository to store your work, clone that repo to local
2. Make requests for API keys for these services:
    - [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/)
    - [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search)
    - [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
3. Setup a a Trello board or some other workflow assistance tool
4. Setup a server for the app's backend
5. Deploy the server using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
